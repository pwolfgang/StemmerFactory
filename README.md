# StemmerFactory

This is a class that us used to find the language appropriate stemming algorithm.
The stemming algorighms are provided by  http://snowballstem.org/. The source
code was forked from https://github.com/snowballstem/snowball into 
https://github.com/pwolfgang/snowball. The java stemmers were then built and
the resulting source then stored in https://github.com/pwolfgang/JavaStemmers.
